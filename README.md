# Privacy preserving information retrieval
In modern search engines, [personalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_search) introduces potential risk of revealing user privacy by identifying their underlying interests from their logged search behaviors. As a solution of this problem we proposed a client-centered approach to hide user intents. We prevent search engine from building true user profile by injecting cover queries with the original user query in a controlled way. Each user's query is submitted with a set of cover queries which carry similar amount of information to generalize user profile while still having some personalization. We used [LDA-C topic](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/lda-c/) modeling to generate topic proportion of the original query. By using this topic proportion we used [language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model) to generate cover queries of similar entropy but on unrelated topics. We have done extensive experiments to evaluate our model using AOL search log and showed effectiveness of our work over two other previous works.
